        <h3>What problem am I trying to solve?</h3>

<p>The code needs lots of conditionals spread across parsing and type solving to deal with every quirk of the Ruby language and libraries
I wish to support.</p>

<p>The parser should not know about RSpec-specific DSL. The parser should not know about Rails-specific DSL.</p>

<h3>What can I do about it?</h3>

<h4>1. Nothing</h4>

<p>Fine for a while, gets worse as the code grows.</p>

<h4>2. Move conditionals to a module with a descriptive name (increase greppability)</h4>

<p>Worse than doing nothing. It still has the same problems but more with indirection.</p>

<h4>3. Decouple core from lib specific behaviour</h4>

<p>Move all lib specific code closed together. Core broadcasts events (<code>reference_added</code>, <code>scope_defined</code>, <code>type_solved</code>, etc.) that each extension can listen to and do something about. The dependency happens in one direction: extensions knows about core, core does not know about extensions.</p>

<p>A consequence of this design is exposing core&#39;s types (<code>Reference::Record</code>, <code>Scope::Record</code>, <code>TypeInference::Clue::*</code>, <code>TypeInference::Conclusion</code>, etc.). All of those things that were private before becomes part of the public contract. I&#39;m OK with that.</p>

<p>By the way, this approach is known as microkernel architecture or plugin architecture.</p>

<h3>How can I know I&#39;ve chosen the best solution?</h3>

<ul>
<li>If I need to change a library because their API changed, all changes are closed together.</li>
<li>If I want to support a new library, code gets added, no changed.</li>
<li>There should be no regression in existing libraries when adding a new one.</li>
</ul>
