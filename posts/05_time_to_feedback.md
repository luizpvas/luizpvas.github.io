How fast can you...

* ... know the code you're writing has no typos or syntax errors?
* ... know the function you're writing returns the correct value?
* ... know the function you're writing performs the correct side-effects?
* ... know the code you're writing does not break some other part of the app? Does a green test suite
  give you enough confidence or do you have to push to a staging environment and watch the app for a couple days to make sure?
* ... deploy code to production? How often?
* ... know the code you just deployed did not impact the overall performance of the system?
* ... know customers want the thing you're building?
* ... know an idea is worth persuing?
* ... notice something is wrong with your software? Do your customers have to tell you?
* ... review a pull request?
