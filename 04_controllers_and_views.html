        <p>In server-side rendered web applications, views are functions <code>args -&gt; string</code> and controllers are functions <code>untrusted_args -&gt; string</code>. Controllers authorize the request, validate inputs, run some queries, etc. and then respond with a <code>render</code> call.</p>

<p>Controllers are responsible for gathering and formatting data needed <strong>for a specific view</strong>, with the specific names and fields the view requires. Even though the controller does not care about how things look visually and how they&#39;re arranged, it has to know about the shape of the data.</p>

<p>But the dependency goes both ways. Views know about controllers just as much as controllers know about views.
You can&#39;t just change the endpoint of a form or remove a field and expect the app to continue working.
Forms submit data to one specific endpoint.
Controllers render one specified view.</p>

<p>Think about how often you have to change both of them, in the same pull request, to ship a working feature to production.</p>

<h3>Code that changes together should be close together</h3>

<p>Code that changes together should be in the same file. Files that change together should be in the same directory. You should be able to look at the directory structure of your app and understand what is is about, what it does, what things are related to what things.</p>

<p>If that sounds similar to the S principle in SOLID, it does because it is.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of the opposite idea of &quot;code that changes together should be close together&quot;:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">my_app/
  controllers/
    billing/
      payment_controller.rb
  validators/
    billing/
       payment_validator.rb
  serializers/
    billing/
      payment_serializer.rb
  models/
    billing/
      payment.rb
  views/
    billing/
      payments/
        new.html.erb
</code></pre>

<p>All those abstractions look like they&#39;re about the same feature, don&#39;t they? Why do we insist in putting them so far apart from each other?</p>

<h3>Controllers and views next to each other</h3>

<p>Rails has the method <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.0/classes/ActionView/ViewPaths/ClassMethods.html#method-i-prepend_view_path"><code>prepend_view_path</code></a> that adds additional lookup paths for templates. You can now place your views wherever it makes more sense for your app.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  prepend_view_path Rails.root.join(&quot;app/controllers&quot;)
end
</code></pre>
